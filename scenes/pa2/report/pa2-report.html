**Programming Assignment 2 - Hao Sun**

Feedback
========

* I spent one hour on project design, then two hours implementing basic parts. As I took parallelized octree construction into account in the beginning, it only took half an hour to have a look at TBB and parallelize octree construction. In the end, I spent two hours on this report.

* One thing I find interesting in this project is that, sometimes after I split a octree node, some children nodes have same number of faces as parent node has. This will happen if all faces cover multiple subregions. I add some check for this, and it's proved that limiting depth of tree is enough.

Environment
===========

* I have an Intel Core i7-6600U CPU in my laptop. It has 2 cores and 4 threads. In the experiment, all threads can be used, but sometimes other programs may occupy some source.

* I have 16GB memory in my laptop, and nori never uses all memory.

* Nori runs on Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS 64-bit.

Part 1: Octree construction
===========================

* I construct the octree in a two-step way, which helps in parallelizing octree construction.

  Data of octree node is as follow:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
private:
    BoundingBox3f m_bbox;           ///< Bounding box of the octree node
    OctreeNode *children = nullptr;
    std::vector<uint32_t> *temp_triangles = nullptr;
    uint32_t num_triangle = 0;
    uint32_t *triangles = nullptr;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* When I build the octree, first, I need to initialize the root node. I set `m_bbox` as bounding box of the mesh and save all indexes in `temp_triangles`.
  Then I can build octree recursively.

  Before a octree node is processed, `m_bbox` and `temp_triangles` should be set correctly. What's more, I need to provide depth of the node, and mesh for this tree.

  Then, I just need to split the bounding box and get eight children. I can put triangles into corresponding child or children, and prepare to process child nodes later.

  If the depth is more than 9 or number of triangles in this bounding box is less than 10, I can stop and make a leaf node.

* Q1: As we can see, I store bounding box of the node and number of triangles in this node in octree node.

  If a node is a parent node, I also store children nodes in this node. Otherwise `children` is just a NULL pointer.

  If a node is a leaf node, I store faces in this node. Otherwise `triangles` is just a NULL pointer.

  Actually, `temp_triangles` is just used to build the tree. It's not needed anymore after building the tree, and it should be a NULL pointer after building the tree.

* Q2: One octree node object occupies 56 bytes. However, as I have some pointer in octree node, it uses more memory than it looks like.

  When I build the tree, `temp_triangles` uses some memory. However, after building the tree, it should be just a NULL pointer. Actually, if we will use the tree a lot of times after building it, and we need to save memory, it's a good choice to convert the tree to a new tree without this member variable. I don't think we need to do it in this stage.

  A parent node should have a non-NULL pointer in `children`. However, it just points to an array storing eight children nodes. So this variable won't occupy additional memory.

  A leaf node should have a non-NULL pointer in `triangles`. It points to an array storing all faces, so it occupies another `num_triangle * 4` bytes.

  In conclusion, a parent node occupies 56 bytes, and a leaf node occupies `56 + num_triangle * 4` bytes.

* Q3: I run the serial construction 5 times, and it takes 1.7 second in average. Actually, it takes 1.7 seconds 4 times.

  I do something to prevent too many repeated nodes, so the result can be a little different from other implementation.

  In my implementation, octree for `ajax.obj` has 216057 interior nodes and 1512400 leaf nodes.

  On leaf nodes, there are 6046707 faces, and average number of triangles per leaf nodes is about 4. Another interesting things is that we have 544566 faces actually, so we have 11.1 times faces on leaf nodes.

* Actually I do something to stop meaningless repetition.

  One useful thing is that, if all children nodes have the same number of triangles as parent node, all children nodes are removed, and the parent node becomes a leaf node. I actually do this in my implementation. 

  Another stretegy is that, if all children nodes are leaf nodes, and number of triangles are the same as parent node or 0, all children nodes are removed, and parent node becomes a leaf node. I have tried this strategy, but this performs worse in rendering. Maybe the reason is that some rays can go through empty children.

Part 2: Ray traversal
=====================

* Here, I add `rayIntersect` for an octree node. It check if the ray intersect bounding box of the node first. If it doesn't intersect, I don't need to do more check, and just return false.

  Then, if the node is an interior node, I just call `rayIntersect` for all children, and use the nearest intersection as the result.

  If the node is a leaf node, I use brute force algorithm to find intersection.

* Q1: I run the program 5 times with original xml file, and use average time as result.

  Parallel rendering takes 18.4s, and serial rendering takes 50.2s.

* Q2: To obtain an estimate of the time required by the brute force algorithm, I reduce resolution to 76 * 76, and only sample once per pixel. It should just use 1/3200 computation.

  In this test, brute force algorithm takes 55.3s, and octree algorithm takes 21ms. If we compare directly, octree gives 2633x speed-up. As octree algorithm runs too fast in the low resolution, the result may be just approximate.

  Then we can estimate time required by brute force algorithm for the original xml file. It will take `55.3 * 768 * 768 * 32 / 76 / 76 = 180705s`. Then we know that octree gives 9821x speed-up.

Part 3: Improved ray traversal
======================

* Now I add an ordered traversal of child nodes. First, I check if the ray intersect bounding boxes of children. I also get the near intersections.

  Then, I sort the nodes in an ascending order based on the near intersection.

  After that, I do ordered traversal. As bounding boxes of children nodes don't overlap each other, if I can find an intersection face in a previous child, I won't be able to find a nearer intersection face in a following child. So, when I find an intersection, I can return it immediately, and don't need to do more check.

* Q2: I run the program 5 times with original xml file, and use average time as result.

  The improved version takes 10.3s.

* Q3: The improved version gives about 1.8x speed-up compared to original octree algorithm.

Bonus: Hacker Points, Parallel Octree Construction
==================================================

* As I design for parallelized construction in the beginning, it's pretty easy to parallelize construction. After I process a node, I just put information its children need into its children, so the children nodes can be processed individually. So I actually split a large task into 8 smaller tasks, and process them recursively.

  Then we just need to parallelize nodes processing. We can find an official tutorial for ['Divide and Conquer'](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/help/tbb_userguide/Design_Patterns/Divide_and_Conquer.html), and [document of parallel_invoke](https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/506168). I do the same thing to parallelize octree construction

* I run the program 5 times, and average time of octree construction is 914ms. Compared to 1.7s, which serial construction takes, the parallized version gives about 1.86x speed-up.


Exercise writeup
================

* Structure your report using numbers and titles following those of the assignment.

* For every task include all images you generated in a format that is viewable within a web browser. You can use HDRI Tools, or photoshop to tonemap you images and save them as jpgs or pngs. We recommend tonemapping your images by just changing exposure and using sRGB (if available) or a gamma of 2.2.

* Include descriptions of encountered problems, a list of external libraries that you used (if applicable) and the time you spent on each task.
